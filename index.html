              <p>Dr Bob Cvetkovic's website suffered a catastrophic loss of data post migration of domain hosting services. The previous website was a simple landing page. An entire rebuild and rebrand was decided upon. The idea was to have a more meaningful impact with his online presence, offering general oral health information and resources to keep his patients up to date with the lastest verifiable oral health information available.</p>
